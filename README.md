## Introduction
I have created a C#/XAML game using Visual Studio 2015.
The game was inspired by the popular Simon Game in which a sequence is played to the user and the user must replicate this sequence.
There is a limit of 50, so when the user replicates a sequence that is 50 long, the game is won and a winner message is displayed to the user.
The game starts out with a sequence of 1 and increments by one each time.
Upon losing a message will be displayed allowing the user to click the start button and play again.
A sound will play when the user gets the sequence right and the counter will increment.
The webiste I used for the audio file can be found here:

[Sound File](soundfxnow.com/), I used the "shiny-ding" mp3 file.
